First day solved leetcode problem one. The nested loops concepts is hard to understand fully.
re emphasis on list, with the index.

Solved 7 leetcode questions. Now pretty stuck. Realized have to push myself further to understand
more questions.

Also starting the python basic now, so I understand the language and feel it better.

Huge progress on leetcode questions. After using the inspector aka debugger. I can suddenly understand
the code so much faster. Solved question faster. and know the logic.!!!

I can see myself make huge progress this month on leetcode.

lol finished the concept of HTML in one day. Complete understand now.
