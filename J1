First day solved leetcode problem one. The nested loops concepts is hard to understand fully.
re emphasis on list, with the index.

Solved 7 leetcode questions. Now pretty stuck. Realized have to push myself further to understand
more questions.

Also starting the python basic now, so I understand the language and feel it better.
